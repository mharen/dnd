- **Apollo**, an aarakocra bard who likes fighting with his yklwa, and playing music. 🐨

- **Delta**, a dragonborn ranger who likes long-range fighting. 🐶
- **Reinhardt**, a human fighter who likes fighting with a large hammer. 🐔

## Today’s adventure

Our adventurers awake in their tents next to a stone structure. Oblivious to an obvious trap, **Apollo** finds his knee impaled on a spike. Ouch. On the plus side, the crew is now aware of the trap. **Delta**, **Reinhardt**, and **Blaze** easily avoid the danger.

But there's a new danger: a werebat.

**Delta** inflicts some substantial wounds and the werebat responds in kind. **Apollo** slashes with his sideways scythe, but misses. **Reinhardt** connects his hammer to the werebat's face. **Blaze** curses the werebat with Hexblade's curse and swings his great sword. Critical hit! **Delta** does a spin attack with excalibur and persuades the werebat to transform into a bat and flee. As it flies away, it lets out a painful screech.

Our adventures enter a new room and find themselves mysteriously invigorated. They continue exploring until they find a large cavern. From the middle of the room they hear a voice, "I want to suck your blood!" **It's another werebat; bigger and stronger 😱.**

It might be their imagination: the room begins to rumble with [thunderous sound](https://youtu.be/a483kj0sR4c). **Delta** starts things off with a critical hit. The werebat returns the favor by making a critical slash with his claws. **Delta** collapses. **Apollo** successfully strikes with his sideways scythe. **Reinhardt** swings his hammer...but misses. **Blaze** connects with his great sword and the werebat explodes. The crew heals **Delta** and **Reinhardt** recovers a cloak...a bat cloak.

Until next time...

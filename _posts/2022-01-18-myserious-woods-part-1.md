After an extended skirmish, **Blaze** reduces the enemy to dust with a vicious attack resembling a falcon punch. He claims the creature's armor.

The party continues down the path and takes in a view of their surroundings, with varying care. Uh oh.

After a curious battle, involving lots of magic, the vultures disappear.

Everyone continues down the path and they come upon a small stone with a giant sword in it. Without an ounce of hesitation, the group rushes forward and find themselves face to face with numerous enemies. **Delta** manages to disappear 5 goblins. **Apollo** and **Blaze** dispatch with another assortment of creatures.

**Delta** manages to withdraw the sword and calls it Excalibur.

Another path is revealed, which leads to obvious danger. The group wisely decides to rest up before exploring.

Until next time...

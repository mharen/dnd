## Today’s adventure
Our adventurers continue the odd job they picked up from Mr. Beast: cleaning up the basement. They don't worry much about the goblin that vanished and continue sweeping up dust, collecting garbage, and arranging furniture. 

While **Reinhardt** and **Angy Boy** argue over a broom, a bookshelf falls on them. The goblin cackles with glee and combat ensues. **Delta** and **Angy Boy** slay the mischievous goblin with little fanfare.

The crew does a good job and is paid by Mr. Beast each with their choice of two gold coins, or an old token to the "Laser One Arcade". All adventurers (after a little peer pressure) choose the token over the gold.

Paid for their work, the boys head out to the street and find the following establishments:

1. Apothecary
2. Four Knights Gym and Training Center
3. Mine and Craft General Store
4. Ghoul’s Spirit Halloween Emporium
5. Blazer’s Phasers and Lasers Arcade

With positively no debate, all race to *Blazer's Phasers and Lasers Arcade.* Strange wardrobe-sized boxes with spectral figures line the walls. Above each box is a glowing emblem. The two boxes near the door read *Chariot Cart Racing* and *Incredible Crush Peasants*. Deeper into the building is an open arched doorway with a glowing sign that reads "Phaser Laser Tag".

The boys ignore the fantastical gaming machines and head through the doorway to *Phaser Laser Tag*. A clerk explains the rules and equips each player with a vest and a phaser laser.

Our five fighters find themselves on one side of a large arena, opposite a crew of five enemies obscured in dark shadow. As the countdown reaches zero and the lights sweep down to the ground they momentarily illuminate the creatures on the other side of the large room: five familiar animals with stern expressions, decked out in their own phaser laser gear.

Urgent concern sweeps through the room as the party is faced with the unthinkable notion of attacking a pet. Amid the anguish, the animals attack. **Angy Boy**, **Thanatos**, and **Reinhardt** are hit.

With the realization that hitting someone reduces their vest's HP, but does not actually inflict any real harm, **Blaze** strikes back. Then **Delta**. When **Reinhardt** begins to attack he notices something strange. To his left is a dog and to his right is a cat. His feet are chicken feet. Suddenly the "phaser" part of this place makes sense.

For a few minutes adventurer and animal exchange phaser laser blasts and in doing so hop from body to body. It is all extremely confusing!

After a few blasts, a couple of players find their vests depleted of hit points. They are pulled through the air and held to the walls by an unseen force. From his unwilling perch on the wall, **Thanatos** casts *Earth Tremor*. While luck favors the group and they endure little damage, the spell disrupts the game and the match ends. The clerk announces the end and escorts the players (and their pets) out of the arena.

For succeeding through recent events, each character earns 100 experience points.

Until next time...

## Homework
None.

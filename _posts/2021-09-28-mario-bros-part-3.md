M is the dungeon master for this campaign.

## Todayâ€™s adventure

In addition to the goodies our party received in the last battle, everyone has a purple hand they can use to shoot Ditto slime as a ranged weapon. **Yoshi** summons a lucky goomba. One falls from the sky and begins attacking him. It is easily smooshed.

After some deliberation, the party enters the giant Bowser Cave. They perceive a variety of enemies, some more than others. Luigi and **Yoshi** are caught unaware by some flying fists.

**Toad** contorts his light sabers into a kamehameha and hits Bowser. Bowser is about the size of four large trampolines. Luigi launches Ditto slime, in the form of a snowball, at Bowserâ€™s face. Itâ€™s a miss. **Mario** tosses Cappy at Bowserâ€™s nose and misses.

Bowser returns **Toad**â€™s kamehameha with his own kamehameha, and delivers 5 damage. Ouch! Various Koopa Troopas mimic Bowserâ€™s attach and direct their energy to **Luigi**, hitting him for 3 damage.

**Yoshi** transmogrifies some Ditto slime into a spear and looses it at Bowser. Miss! **Toad** attempts another kamehameha and itâ€™s a hit! **Luigi** misses with another snowball. **Mario** tries again with Cappy and misses ðŸ˜¢.

Bowser leaps high into the air and spirit bombs the party, inflicting significant damage to all nearby creatures and party members, and in doing so, Bowser also destroys himself. **Yoshi** revives a fainted **Toad**.

The pressure wave of Bowser's attack rushes all party members out of the game and back into the arcade with a few interesting artifacts:

* **Delta** has a shapeshifting dagger
* **Reinhardt** has Hatty, a hat that charms the wearer
* **Blaze** has a sharp tongue, which is apparently some sort of melee weapon
* **Angy Boy** has carnage venom tentacles

Time to rest. Until next time...

## Homework

None.

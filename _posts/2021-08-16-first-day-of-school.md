Our party of brave adventurers find themselves without their gear, spells, and usual grit. Instead they inhabit unfamiliar human flesh bodies. They awake suddenly on a school bus. Present are M, B, P, and L. They seem to be at Lakeview Intermediate School. They enter the school and begin exploring. They quickly find three main areas:

* West: library
* East: cafeteria
* North: kitchen

The adventurers find potential pets caged in the cafeteria: 🐱, 🐨, 🐔, 🐶, and 🐱. The key to releasing the captive creatures must be elsewhere.

Upon entering the library the adventurers face off with a curious ghost who is interested in learning new things. M, B, P, and L share curious facts and ultimately defeat the enemy. They recover a key.

The key unlocks the animal cages but they do not flee.

The adventures discover supplies for the creatures in the kitchen and use these to entice them out of their cages. Each member imprints on a creature:

* M: 🐨
* B: 🐶
* P: 🐱
* L: 🐔

And one 🐱 remains for W.

Our adventurers flee the school, board the bus, and drift off to sleep.

Until next time…

- **Blaze**, a dragonborn warlock who likes fighting with his mace, and magic. 🐱
- **Magnus**, a fire genasi sorcerer who likes fighting with dual scimitars. 🐨
- **Reinhardt**, a human fighter who likes fighting with a large hammer. 🐔
- **Delta**, a Dragonborn ranger who likes long-range fighting. 🐶
- **Angy Boy**, a goliath cleric who likes fighting with a mace and crossbow. 🐱

**Reinhardt** takes the lead today.

## Today’s adventure

Our party is still in the Ruins of Thundertree, a long-abandoned village with collapsed cottages, overgrown paths, and a large stone tower. They have rested in an old cottage after dispensing with its prior inhabitants.

They have rested in a ruined store (area 6) after dispensing with some tough spiders.

**Reinhardt** decisively leads the group down the road to the Smithy (area 8). He opens the door and enters. The group follows. **Delta** and **Magnus** are the first to spot a couple of Ash Zombies.

They strike as the zombies are rousing. **Delta** and **Magnus** are able to deliver significant damage, and avoid a threatening puff of ash that follows their strikes.

The zombies strike back by throwing themselves at their attackers. **Reinhardt**, **Angy Boy**, and **Blaze** join in the attack and the zombies are quickly turned into piles of bones. The adventurers wait cautiously in case the bones revive themselves but they do not.

The group takes careful stock of their surroundings and find all sorts of smith tools, including hammers, tongs, and a bellows. **Blaze** and **Delta** also try to take an anvil and only manage to just lift it, but leave it.

They make camp.

Until next time...

## Getting started

- **Angy Boy**, a goliath cleric who likes fighting with a mace and crossbow. 🐱
- **Apollo**, an aarakocra bard who likes fighting with his yklwa, and playing music. 🐨
- **Delta**, a dragonborn ranger who likes long-range fighting. 🐶
- **Blaze**, a dragonborn warlock who likes fighting with his mace, and magic. 🐱

## Today’s adventure

After reconciling with the crumbling cube monster, the adventurers continue on their way. They discover more cube monsters! **Apollo** tries out his new sideways scythe with great success. **Delta** throws hands and takes out another cube monster. **Blaze** flattens another cube monster with his great club, but the squishy creature does not perish. **Angy Boy** finishes the job.

The group continues down the path and eventually come upon a quiet village. They loot the first house they see and discover three chests. One chest is half-filled with magic pudding--it's whatever flavor you want it to be. The remaining treasures include 500 gold, and **Blaze** finds a pair of web shooters. Oh, and 800 silver pieces to share

Until next time...

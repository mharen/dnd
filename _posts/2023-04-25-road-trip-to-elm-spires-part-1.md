## Introductions

- Milo is a L2 Cleric and L2 Blood Hunter. Can animate dead enemies
- Brandon is a blank piece of paper
- Wes is human cleric, multiclassing, catch phrase: "not yet"
- Lorcan is the almighty and powerful Beanos, "I am inedible"
- Parker is Genji warlock, catch phrase: "take the blade of the dragon god", gets HP when he slays something, immune to fire

A **knock** at the door.

Parker investigates the door. Capybara runs away. He retrieves a box.

In the box:

- Lorcan finds a case which he believes contains a split atom inside, hoping it is a possible atomic weapon
- Milo finds a golden eagle figure, which can turn into a real eagle that can spy for him. Basically an amiibo
- Brandon finds a dog whistle
- Wes finds Batman utility belt with grappling hook and other cool things
- Parker finds a robust ping pong paddle
- At the bottom of the box are some golden tickets with an address, etc. for Elm Spires

They find a cart+horses outside (no cars). They fight some ants and defeat them.

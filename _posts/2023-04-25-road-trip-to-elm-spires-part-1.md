- B is a blank piece of paper
- W is human cleric, multiclassing, catch phrase: "not yet"
- L is the almighty and powerful Beanos, "I am inedible"

A **knock** at the door.

P investigates the door. Capybara runs away. He retrieves a box.

In the box:

- L finds a case which he believes contains a split atom inside, hoping it is a possible atomic weapon
- M finds a golden eagle figure, which can turn into a real eagle that can spy for him. Basically an amiibo
- B finds a dog whistle
- W finds Batman utility belt with grappling hook and other cool things
- P finds a robust ping pong paddle
- At the bottom of the box are some golden tickets with an address, etc. for Elm Spires

They find a cart+horses outside (no cars). They fight some ants and defeat them.

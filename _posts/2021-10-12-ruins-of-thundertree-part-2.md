- **Blaze**, a dragonborn warlock who likes fighting with his mace, and magic. 🐱
- **Magnus**, a fire genasi sorcerer who likes fighting with dual scimitars. 🐨
- **Reinhardt**, a human fighter who likes fighting with a large hammer. 🐔
- **Delta**, a dragonborn ranger who likes long-range fighting. 🐶

Blaze takes the lead today.

## Today’s adventure

Our party is still in the Ruins of Thundertree, a long-abandoned village with collapsed cottages, overgrown paths, and a large stone tower. They have rested in an old cottage after dispensing with its prior inhabitants.

They cross the street and enter a large, dilapidated--but intact--cottage. They immediately notice four ash zombies.

With a good deal of luck, the party is able to do some serious damage to the zombies before they retaliate. **Delta** and **Blaze** make creative use of curses to further wound two of the zombies. **Angy Boy**, **Reinhardt**, and **Magnus** deal repeated blows.

The zombies respond by hurling themselves into their attackers, and occasionally succeeding in harming them.

The party is surprised to find that zombies are very resilient when two of them mysteriously revive themselves a few times. Ultimately, our brave adventurers prevail by defeating all four zombies and make camp for the night in the moonlight that enters through a zombie-shaped hole in the wall.

Until next time...

## Today‚Äôs adventure

The party awakes on the outskirts of a village. They take up camp and begin to look about the area. They approach a mysterious tent in the middle of town. While **Blaze** is daydreaming, **Delta**, **Angy Boy**, and **Apollo** notice a person inside the tent. The stranger appears to be sleeping. **Blaze** steps on a twig, and the sound rouses the stranger and it immediately lashes out at the intruders. **Apollo** attempts to intimidate the person. **Delta** says hello. The person demands donuts. **Angy Boy** offers a serving a pudding. The person accepts and explains that he is an assassin for hire. He accepts **Apollo**'s offer of some silver and beings traveling with them. His name is unknown.

Our adventurers find a portal and they step through it. They find themselves back in the tent. If only there was some other way out of there ü§î. **Angy Boy** asks Unknown what they should do, and he helps them find a secret tunnel for a small fee. Ignoring Unknown's advice, the group searches everywhere and...sometime later...**Blaze** finds a secret entrance.

Within the newly discovered tunnel there are six paths. They take the sixth path. They find a pack of wild dogs. **Angy Boy** draws his dragon slayer sword and slays an enemy. **Delta** attempts to tame one, but does not succeed. **Apollo** rushes forward eight ft<sup>1</sup> and casts Thunderwave in a 15 foot cube from his position, unaliving the remaining foes.

The party continues exploring and they come upon a person with a knife. **Apollo** instructs Unknown to engage. Unknown dispatches with the person swiftly.

The group heads outside and makes camp.

Until next time...

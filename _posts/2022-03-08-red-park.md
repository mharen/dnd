## Todayâ€™s adventure

The group finds themselves around a table at **M's** house after school. They are retelling rumors heard at school about something strange happening at the nearby Big Red Park. They decide to investigate and set out for the park.

From a distance they can see that there is something strange going on. On approach from the rear, the park seems almost empty and closed behind yellow police tape. There are officers, firefighters, and a small crowd on the street-side of the park. The boys approach the rear edge of the park unnoticed.

After some careful investigation, they notice a curious sight at the center of the large play structure: a goblin guarding an enchanting orb.

Upon seeing the orb, each boy knows instinctively that this orb will grant them immeasurable power. They agree to work together to retrieve the orb.

Although the group split up in order to approach from different sides, all are partially surprised by some poisonous snakes curled around the swing set chains. The boys work together to defeat them with sticks, and their hands and feet.

**P** sneaks into the parking lot and attempts to hijack a car. He hurts his hand very badly on an unyielding window.

**M** makes his way around the structure and begins to climb. He reaches the gobline and delivers a bone-crushing roundhouse kick!

**W** and **L** search for weapons underneath the slide. They find club-like sticks. **L** attempts to climb the slide by slips. **W** finds another way up and manages to swing at the goblin, but _just_ misses. **P** joins **L** under the slide and searches for a stick. He finds one, but it has a giant rat gnawing on one end ðŸ˜±.

**L** and **P** go back and forth with the rat and ultimate manage to scare it off.

The goblin says something cool and then soars down the slide away from the attackers. He takes the orb with him.All the boys pursue the goblin with varying success. The goblin performs a very dramatic kamehameha straight up into the air...into the orb. The orb disappears as if snapped from existence.

Unperturbed at the disappearing reward, the group surrounds the goblin. After a challenging back-and-forth, the goblin is overwhelmed and defeated. Feeling accomplished, and not even a little disappointed, the boys return home.

Until next time...

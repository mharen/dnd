## Today‚Äôs adventure

Our party rouses from their rest and see even more cube monsters have gathered around them. They also notice the tree glitching; it crumbles to the ground and reforms as a huge cube monster.

**Apollo** begins to play ~_Thriller_~ _Never Gonna Give You Up_ on his Lyre. **Delta** enchants a rock with _Inflict Wounds_ and hurls it at the huge cube monster. The cube appears angry. **Angy Boy** sees **Delta's** good idea and does the same thing. The cube monster appears angrier. He does not like _Rick Astley_.

The giant cube monster directs an energy beam to the large building, shattering much of it and harming **Apollo**. It launches two cube monsters at our party members.

**Apollo** defeats one of the small cube monsters with his yklwa. **Delta** pokes the other small cube monster with excalibur. **Angy Boy** rushes towards the statue (from last time) and retrieves its sword. He drives the sword into a small cube inside the large building. As the cube crumbles so do all the cube monsters, small and giant alike.

**Apollo** flies over to where the giant cube monster was and finds a weapon: a sideways scythe.

Until next time...

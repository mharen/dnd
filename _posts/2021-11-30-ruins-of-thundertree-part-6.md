## Getting started

We're still in Thundertree (see also: [part 5]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2021-11-23-ruins-of-thundertree-part-5 %}))!.

- **Blaze**, a dragonborn warlock who likes fighting with his mace, and magic. 🐱
- **Apollo**, an aarakocra bard who likes fighting with his yklwa, and playing music. 🐨
- **Delta**, a dragonborn ranger who likes long-range fighting. 🐶
- **Angy Boy**, a goliath cleric who likes fighting with a mace and crossbow. 🐱

**Angy Boy** takes the lead today.

## Today’s adventure

Our party is still in the Ruins of Thundertree, a long-abandoned village with collapsed cottages, overgrown paths, and a large stone tower.

They have rested in the trees outside of the tower (area 7). **Reinhardt** is away on unknown business.

After their crushing defeat by the dragon, the group is unsure how to proceed. They are spared their own squabbling by a visitor: **Reidoth**. He offers a map to Wave Echo Cave in exchange for their help retrieving a lost necklace. The party accepts the mission and heads down the road following **Reidoth's** instructions.

Trekking down the path, three across, and observing very little, the party is pounced upon by a group of ash zombies. Employing some creativity, **Blaze**, **Delta**, and **Angy Boy** work themselves into a good position and weaken their foes.

The group is joined by a long lost friend: **Apollo**, an aarakocra bard. **Apollo** makes an impressive entrace by swooping into the middle of the battle and slashing at the enemies.

Without coming to much harm, the group manages to defeat the ash zombies.

The adventurers, joined by **Apollo** retreat to their forested camp to rest up before setting out again to find **Reidoth's** necklace.

Until next time...

## Getting started

We're still in Thundertree (see also: [part 4]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2021-11-16-ruins-of-thundertree-part-4 %}))!.

- **Blaze**, a dragonborn warlock who likes fighting with his mace, and magic. 🐱
- **Magnus**, a fire genasi sorcerer who likes fighting with dual scimitars. 🐨
- **Reinhardt**, a human fighter who likes fighting with a large hammer. 🐔
- **Delta**, a dragonborn ranger who likes long-range fighting. 🐶
- **Angy Boy**, a goliath cleric who likes fighting with a mace and crossbow. 🐱

**Magnus** takes the lead today.

## Today’s adventure

Our party is still in the Ruins of Thundertree, a long-abandoned village with collapsed cottages, overgrown paths, and a large stone tower.

They have rested in an old smithy (area 8).

**Magnus** rushes the group towards the tower. Along the way, ground-shaking shrieks give the adventurers pause. They eventually enter a small cottage attached to a large stone tower. After an extended, and increasingly loud deliberation, a smashing noise accompanies the cottages collapse. **Reinhardt** flees to safety in the trees, avoiding the crumbling debris.

The rest of the part forms a brave (or prideful) stand against the dragon that the old man had warned them about. With little effort, the dragon knocks **Blaze**, **Delta**, and **Angy Boy** unconscious. **Magnus** is defeated in what is his final battle.

Some time passes...

When the adventurers come-to, they find themselves in a humble camp. They are tended to by **Reinhardt** who explains that after their defeat, he retrieved and healed them. He gives them the unfortunate news about their fallen friend, **Magnus**.

Until next time...

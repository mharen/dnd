## Getting started
1. Recap of [last week’s]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2021-08-16-first-day-of-school %}) side quest
2. Everyone craves XP
3. New characters!

Our party of brave adventurers is now:
- **Blaze**, a dragonborn warlock who likes fighting with his mace, and magic. 🐱
- **Thanatos**, an earth genasi druid who likes fighting with dual scimitars. 🐨
- **Reinhardt**, a human fighter who likes fighting with a large hammer. 🐔
- **Delta**, a Dragonborn ranger who likes long-range fighting. 🐶
- **Angy Boy**, a goliath cleric who likes fighting with a mace and crossbow. 🐱

Our party members met each other through a long, complicated history that rivals soap opera drama from the 90s. There are multiple sets of twins, distant connections, undiscovered betrayal, and even a couple of dragonborn brothers.

## Today’s adventure
They find themselves at the _Mr. Beast Burgers and More_ restaurant. Mr. Beast is sort of like the beast from “Beauty and the Beast”. He’s a very tough looking creature, polite, and dressed in a suit. He greets our party and helps them order food.

The party argues amongst themselves a bit. Another creature joins the line and attempts to bypass the bickering party. This new creature appears to be two smaller humanoids stacked on top of each other in a trench coat. They speak softly and politely, but are insistent that they need to order and sate their hunger.

The party ignores the new creature in line and ultimately **Blaze** (today’s leader) asks Mr. Beast if there are any quests they might do. The proprietor describes several menu items as if this is a fantasy themed restaurant—#1 Beast Burger Combo, #2 Veggie Burger Combo, etc.

**Blaze** asks about side quests and learns about tots, jalapeño poppers, fries, etc.

The party successfully persuades Mr. Beast of their desires for adventure and he agrees to discuss. The party learns that Mr. Beast’s usual squad had to be “let go” after a misunderstanding about what went into his famous jalapeño poppers, and as chance would have it, he’s in need of a new party of adventurers.

Mr. Beast offers 10 (or is it 5 or 4?) gold pieces if the party will clean up his basement and dispense with any creatures they find. He warns them specifically about the wardrobe. 

The party agrees and heads to the basement. **Thanatos** casts Faery Fire to illuminate the contents of the otherwise dark basement in bright blue outlines. Upon entering the room they meet a friendly creature whom the party calls British. He resembles Rocket from Guardians of the Galaxy. British waits outside while the party begins their work.

It isn’t long before **Reinhardt** approaches the wardrobe. Heeding the warning of Mr. Beast, **Angy Boy** casts Shield of Faith on **Reinhardt** as he opens the wardrobe. Taking no other precautions and making no effort to investigate the wardrobe, **Reinhardt** is surprised by a goblin hiding within. The party spars with the goblin for a few moments and Delta attempts an attack before the goblin distracts the party. When the adventurers return their attention to the wardrobe they find that the goblin has vanished.

Until next time...

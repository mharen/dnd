## Today’s adventure

Our party is still in the Ruins of Thundertree, a long-abandoned village with collapsed cottages, overgrown paths, and a large stone tower. They have rested in an old cottage after dispensing with its prior inhabitants.

They have rested in a large, dilapidated--but intact--cottage, which formerly held some ash zombies (area 3).

After some deliberation, **Angy Boy** leads the party down the road to a better-looking home, with exterior fortifications on its walls, windows, and door (area 4). **Reinhardt** attempts to kick open the door but instead hurts his toe on the solid door. A human occupant inside responds in greeting and after some brief discussion, welcomes the party into his home.

**Reidoth** introduces himself and offers some advice about avoiding the dangers in Thundertree. The party takes these warnings as encouragement and plans to attack a nearby building known to hold giant spiders, and then tackle the large stone tower, which **Reidoth** warns contains a deadly dragon. The group barters with **Reidoth** who agrees to guide them to Wave Echo Cave in exchange for helping him with the dragon.

As a warm up to the dragon, **Angy Boy** leads the group to the giant spiders. Showing no hesitation, **Reinhardt** approaches the web-covered structure and is immediately rendered unconscious by two giant spiders he failed to notice. His companions quickly volley their own attacks. **Delta** increases the effect of a well-placed arrow by enchanting it with Hail of Thorns, **Magnus** inflicts damage to both spiders with dual scimitars, **Angy Boy** harms them with a Word of Radiance, and **Blaze** strikes a pivotal blow.

With a little help from an unfamiliar gray squirrel, the spiders are defeated, **Reinhardt** is revived, and everyone sets up camp.

Until next time...

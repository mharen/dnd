## Getting started

Our party of brave adventurers resume their quest for the **Lost Mine of Phandelver**:

- **Blaze**, a dragonborn warlock who likes fighting with his mace, and magic. 🐱
- **Magnus**, a fire genasi sorcerer who likes fighting with dual scimitars. 🐨
- **Reinhardt**, a human fighter who likes fighting with a large hammer. 🐔
- **Delta**, a dragonborn ranger who likes long-range fighting. 🐶
- **Angy Boy**, a goliath cleric who likes fighting with a mace and crossbow. 🐱

Delta takes the lead today.

## Today’s adventure

Our party made their way from the Cragmaw Hideout, to Phandalin, and is continuing on to Wave Echo Cave. They are now in the Ruins of Thundertree, a long-abandoned village with collapsed cottages, overgrown paths, and a large stone tower.

The group passes by a sign that reads "DANGER! Plant monsters AND zombies! Turn back now!"

They enter the first structure they find: an old, rundown cottage. They easily spot a couple of twig blights and engage in battle. The twigs blights are toast.

Delta leads the group next door to a pair of collapsed cottages where they encounter another six twig blights. This time, they lead with diplomacy. Unfortunately, due to a possible language barrier and impatience on both sides, the parley quickly devolves into all out battle. Of course our adventurers secure the structure after making six piles of wood, ash, and splinters. They search the weedy structure and uncover a chest. Careful to avoid any traps, they recover copper, silver, and gold. All party members try their hand at some quick mental math (and mild subterfuge) and ultimately each takes an even stake of the riches.

Time to rest. Until next time...

## Homework

Adventurers should study their characters sheets. Spell casters should also pick which spells they want to learn from the lists that were passed out.

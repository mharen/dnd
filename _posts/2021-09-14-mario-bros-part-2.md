## Getting started

Our party of brave adventurers continues their ongoing [arcade adventure]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2021-09-07-mario-bros-part-1 %}):

- **Toad** (B)
- **Yoshi** (W)
- **Mario** (L)
- **Luigi** (P)

M is the dungeon master for this campaign.

## Today’s adventure

Leaving Bowser, heading down tunnel. **Toad** attacks Koopa. Damage is done, but he managed to bottle flip a shell on his face, giving him disadvantage on future attacks. Luigi sends a fireball to Koopa, and it's burnt to a crisp. **Luigi** frees the shell from **Toad**’s face and wears it as a hat.

The group heads down a corridor to another room and launches a surprise attack on an unsuspecting goomba. **Mario** flings Cappy at the goomba and smooshes him. The group enters the new room and discovers four Shy Guys. **Yoshi** attempts to eat one but misses. **Toad** jumps at one and where the Shy Guy was, now we see nothing but **Toad**’s light saber buried into the ground. **Luigi** launches a fireball over one’s head. **Mario** also sends a fireball wild. **Yoshi** goes in for another bite and closes his mouth over a vanishing Shy Guy. **Luigi** opens a diplomatic conversation with a fireball and another Shy Guy vanishes. **Mario** sends another fireball wild, but on a second try finds his target. The fourth and final Shy Guy vanishes.

All uninjured Shy Guys blink back into view and shape shift into figures resembling each player, but with narrow dots for eyes. They begin attacking wildly. **Toad** and **Yoshi** take some damage. **Luigi** and **Mario** respond with on-target fireballs. **Toad** slashes one with his light saber. The **Mario** ditto tosses his Cappy at the wall and begins to transform; boulders begin to fall. 

The melee continues until all copies are extinguished. The party picks up some nice things:

* **Luigi** picks up a Shy Guy mask and gains the ability to blink out and in of the current plane of existence. His fireballs also do additional damage.
* **Mario’s** Cappy gets its own Cappy.
* **Yoshi** learns how to spawn a lucky block goomba every five minutes.
* **Toad** picks up several ditto sabers, giving him two dual light sabers. When combined in different arrangements, the sabers can be used as a bow, a trident, an umbrella, etc.

Time to rest. Until next time...

## Homework

None.

## Getting started

**L** is leading the adventure today.

We're continuing the Tree of Dark Matter (see also: [part 4]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2022-02-22-tree-of-dark-matter-part-4 %}))!.

- **Apollo**, an aarakocra bard who likes fighting with his yklwa, and playing music. 🐨
- **Angy Boy**, a goliath cleric who likes fighting with a mace and crossbow. 🐱
- **Blaze**, a dragonborn warlock who likes fighting with his mace, and magic. 🐱

## Today’s adventure

The group awakens to find **Delta** is missing, presumably he's fallen into the void. They head back to the six paths and choose path number four. They are met by a giant humanoid hamster. **Apollo** asks Unknown to deal with the creature but finds that Unknown's whereabouts are unknown. **Angy Boy** offers the monster some hamster flavored pudding and it vanishes. 🤮.

The group continues down the path and discover another portal. They jump through. There is corruption everywhere. There are cube monsters everywhere. **Apollo** and **Blaze** are unable to damange any cubes. Suddenly an apparent hive-mind queen emerges and the party goes wild. **Angy Boy** casts Word of Radiance and harms all nearby cubes.

After a prolonged argument, all party members collapse with tranquilizer darts sticking out of their necks.

Until next time...

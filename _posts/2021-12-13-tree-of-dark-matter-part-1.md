## Today’s adventure

Our adventurers find themselves in an unfamiliar village. Many of the houses appear to be corrupted. A quick investigation reveals a large tree of dark matter at the center of the village. The corruption is spreading.

**Delta** begins checking uncorrupted houses to see if any villagers can be rescued. He discovers a zombie and quickly destroys it. **Angy Boy**, **Apollo**, and **Blaze** join in the effort and begin clearing house after house. Along the way they defeat numerous zombies.

Delta discovers that touching the corruption is not a good idea as it begins to spread to anything that touches it. He withdraws and manages to escape the corruption.

Eventually, the adventurers encounter a statue near the tree. Delta reads a message below the statue that reads:

> A savior of this village, the dragon slayer

**Delta** investigates a large, partially corrupted building near the statue. He finds a map showing the current village among its neighboring villages. The map indicates that some nearby villages are corrupted. **Delta** moves to the corrupted side of the building, dragging **Blaze** along. They discover a table holding a purple cube.

**Angy Boy** follows into the building and explores. Meanwhile, **Apollo** flies around the tree playing sounds. Cube monsters begin to swarm and he drops a handful of arrows. One cube monster is struck by several arrows.

Aware of their own weariness the group retreats to the large building to camp for the night. A hoard of zombies roams the village.

Until next time...

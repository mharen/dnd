## Getting started

Fresh out of an exciting game of [laser tag]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2021-08-31-laser-tag %}), our party heads to the row of fantastical gaming machines. They find themselves transported into a familiar game: Mario Bros. Our party of brave adventurers is:

- **Toad** (B)
- **Yoshi** (W)
- **Mario** (L)
- **Luigi** (P)

M is the dungeon master for this campaign.

## Todayâ€™s adventure

Our adventurers find themselves in a strange stone dungeon. Ahead is some sort of turtle monster. **Mario** yeets his cap (**Cappy**) at the Koopa Troopa and successfully charms it; Koopa joins the party.

**Toad** (today's leader) navigates the party through hallways and rooms. They encounter several more Koopa Troopas and Goombas and dispense with them easily.

The party stumbles into a large cavernous room and meets their first major obstacle: **Darth Vader**. A creative battle ensues, including our charmed Koopa Troopa and ultimately **Mario** and **Luigi** offer sufficient resistance to defeat their foe. All present attempt to recover the villain's light saber, but only **Toad** manages to control it (it pierces enemies with `1D8` damage).

On their way to the next room, **Yoshi** eats a Goomba and **Toad** sneak-attacks with his new light saber to slice one in half. In the next room they find a formidable adversary: the **Oracle of Trophonius**. During the lengthy battle, the Oracle is able to anticipate the parties' actions and counter their attacks. Ultimately, though, the adventurers prove strong. **Toad** deals the final strikes and the Oracle is no more. **Yoshi** recovers a crystal ball and in doing so gains the Oracle's ability to counter others' attacks. He also recovers the Oracle's cloak, granting `+2 AC`. Cappy is damaged during the battle.

While traveling down the hallway, the party is surprised by a Koopa Troopa, who deals a sharp punch to the faces of **Yoshi** and **Toad**. **Luigi** responds in kind and defeats the Koopa Troopa with one swing. However, **Luigi** then loses track of his surroundings as he chases the newly freed turtle shell into a large room and receives a stunning hit from a gargantuan monster: **Bowser**. The group exchanges fireballs, slashes, and punches. It's a bit of give and go and ultimately **Bowser** succumbs to attacks from **Toad** and **Yoshi**. **Mario** recovers **Bowser's** spiked shell and uses it to repair and improve **Cappy** with a new attack that deals `1D8` piercing damage. 

The party then quickly attends to a few remaining Goombas, and in defeating them discover that these Goombas yield some lucky abilities:

* **Luigi** gains `+1 AC`
* **Mario** gains `+1 attack`
* **Yoshi** gains `-1 AC` (not all lucky things are good ðŸ˜­)

Our friends take a rest.

Until next time...

**P** is leading the adventure today. We're continuing the Mysterious Woods (see also: [part 1]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2022-01-18-mysterious-woods-part-1 %}))!.

- **Apollo**, an aarakocra bard who likes fighting with his yklwa, and playing music. 🐨
- **Blaze**, a dragonborn warlock who likes fighting with his mace, and magic. 🐱
- **Delta**, a dragonborn ranger who likes long-range fighting. 🐶
- **Reinhardt**, a human fighter who likes fighting with a large hammer. 🐔

## Today’s adventure

Our adventurers awake again in their tests. They proceed down the path they saw yesterday and find a large clearing. A large troll strolls into view.

A battle begins immediately and hit points rapidly start falling all around. **Reinhardt** and **Delta** miss. **Blaze** missed with an arrow, but successfully curses the troll. **Apollo** inspires **Reinhardt** with a melody about tacos 🌮 raining 🌮 from 🌮 the 🌮 sky and then swings his sideways scythe at the troll, inflicting critical damage.

The troll lashes out at **Delta** but **Delta** manages to dodge.

**Reinhardt** lands a critical hit with his hammer.

Through a series of creative attacks, the party manages to weaken the troll. But the troll does not go without a fight; he knocks **Blaze** unconscious. **Delta** revives **Blaze** while **Apollo** finishes off the troll.

**Apollo** recovers an interesting weapon: a goblin mask.

Everyone passes out and reawakens in their tents. But there's an extra tent. And they're in a cave 🤔. They begin exploring the cave. Suddenly, **Blaze** is surrounded by vampire bats and takes some serious damage.

The group attacks the swarm and eventually defeats it. The group finds a nice place to make camp.

Until next time...
